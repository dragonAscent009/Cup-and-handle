# Cup-and-handle
The Equity markets are reputedly complex to understand which makes identifying stock opportunities dependent on experience and continuous analysis. Technical analysts analyze the movement of the stock price over a period and have been able to identify unique formations which have a high probability of resulting in money spinners. The technical analysis of equities of identifying formations is an arduous and repetitive tasks. Since it involved executing the repetitive steps over and over again, it was a candidate for automating the analysis by programming. 
One such formation is the “Cup & Handle” which are highly sought out by technical traders as they are considered to be a lucrative trade. These formations are however rare and only a few can be found after scanning through hundreds of stocks. This program attempts to automate the arduous task of the trader by using mathematical relationships between stock prices over a period of several months to identify these formations. This programming was done using C++ QT framework. The program scans the price movement over a long period to identify the “Cup and Handle” formation thus providing insight into lucrative equity trades
