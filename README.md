# Cup-and-handle
When trying to predict stock market trends using computers the first thing that comes to mind is using neural nets for time series or sentiment analysis. This project however takes a diffrent approach to the problem. Stock amrket analysis has been done be traders for decades manually by looking at charts. So instead of developing new models and theories for predicting trends this project tries to automate one of the tecniques already used by professional traders. 

Traders look for formations in charts formed my movement of price over time. 
One such formation is the “Cup & Handle” which are highly sought out by technical traders as they are considered to be a lucrative trade. These formations are however rare and only a few can be found after scanning through hundreds of stocks. This program attempts to automate the arduous task of the trader by using mathematical relationships between stock prices over a period of several months to identify these formations. This programming was done using C++ QT framework. The program scans the price movement over a long period to identify the “Cup and Handle” formation thus providing insight into lucrative equity trades

The .pro file can be opened in QT. In the absence of QT the individual files are also uploaded
